    <h1> A detail-oriented software engineer with a passion for creativity and a background in teaching</h1>

    <p>As a software engineer with a background in K-12 music education, I bring a unique perspective to the world of technology. With a BA of Music in music education from Western Michigan University and a certificate in Software Engineering from Flatirons School Bootcamp, I combine my love of music and passion for coding to create beautiful and functional websites and applications. </p>

    <p> As a freelance developer, I work on full-stack projects using React, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails as my main tech stack. But when I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in my many hobbies, including creating art, playing music, taking care of my plants, and rock climbing. </p>

    <p>My teaching experience has also helped me become a better developer. It has taught me to pay close attention to detail and to be a great listener, allowing me to fully understand the needs of my clients and create customized solutions for them. I am known for my drive, quick work, and strong communication skills, which help me ensure that projects are completed efficiently and effectively.</p>

    <p> In short, I have a ton of passion for the work that I bring to this world! Please feel free to contact me, even if it is just to say hello!</p>
